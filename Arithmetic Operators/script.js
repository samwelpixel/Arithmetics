/* This code performs a series of calculations based on user input and then displays the result using document.write(). Here's a breakdown of the code:

var numberSeven = Number(prompt("Enter the number 7"));

The user is prompted to enter a number, and the value they enter is stored in the variable numberSeven.
var birthMonth = Number(prompt("Enter your birth month"));

The user is prompted to enter their birth month, and the value they enter is stored in the variable birthMonth.
var calculation = numberSeven * birthMonth;

The variable calculation is assigned the result of multiplying numberSeven and birthMonth.
calculation = calculation - 1;

1 is subtracted from the value of calculation and the result is stored back in calculation.
calculation = calculation * 13;

The value of calculation is multiplied by 13 and the result is stored back in calculation.
var birthDay = Number(prompt("Enter the day of your birth"));

The user is prompted to enter their birth day, and the value they enter is stored in the variable birthDay.
calculation = calculation + birthDay;

The value of birthDay is added to calculation, and the result is stored back in calculation.
calculation = calculation + 3;

3 is added to the value of calculation and the result is stored back in calculation.
calculation = calculation * 11;

The value of calculation is multiplied by 11 and the result is stored back in calculation.
calculation = calculation - birthMonth;

The value of birthMonth is subtracted from calculation, and the result is stored back in calculation.
calculation = calculation - birthDay;

The value of birthDay is subtracted from calculation, and the result is stored back in calculation.
calculation = calculation / 10;

The value of calculation is divided by 10, and the result is stored back in calculation.
calculation = calculation + 10;

10 is added to the value of calculation, and the result is stored back in calculation.
calculation = calculation / 100;

The value of calculation is divided by 100, and the result is stored back in calculation.
document.write("Your birthday is " + calculation);

The resulting value of calculation is displayed on the web page using `
